It's been hectic 2 weeks and I didn't have much time to work on side projects unfortunately.

All I did is watch a couple of tutorials on authentication/authorization and how it works on both the backend and frontend and how to implement it in a project, so that I can start working on it. I also read a number of articles and watched a couple of videos on the topic of using 3rd party services for authentication, to see what will be best and if I should even try to implement such a feature in my app. 

For the moment though, no coding has been done in that regard and as such, not much to share in this entry. 

More on it the next time.
