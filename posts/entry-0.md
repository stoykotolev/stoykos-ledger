I've had this idea for a large scale project for a number of months now.

It's a great idea, I think. 

Unfortunately, something always comes up and I scrap it for "next week". Be it a legitimate reason, a convenient excuse or just plain ole' procrastination.

The idea itself is big. So I get why I procrastinate and avoid starting it. There are so many features in the scope itself, I know I don't know where to start.

And I want to be able to hold myself accountable and actually start working on the project itself.

What better way to do that, than to work on another project, waste a few more weeks and try to distract myself from the main goal? Well, been there, done that (that "other project" is released though. So that's something. Definitely not finished yet, so yeah). 

That's why I'm starting this website-ledger. To have a countdown. New entry in the log, every 2 weeks, with progress on the project I want to work. Some entries will be just research on the tech I'll be using or implementing. Some entries will be about the project's architecture or changes to it, at some point that's gonna happen - let's face it. Some entries will be pure code. Algorithms on the back-end. Logic on the front-end. (I'll also have to write CSS, so there's that). Some entries will be blueprinting about the upcoming features and whatnot.

So yeah. On to blueprinting and documenting stuff and posting every 2 weeks.
